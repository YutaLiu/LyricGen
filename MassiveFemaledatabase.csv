Camila Cabello,“Our Dreams Were Bigger Than Our Fears” - Essay,A bus. The yellow lighting of the gas station against the dark hours of midnight. Fast asleep. Silence. My head slumped over my mom's shoulder. Her voice timid and hesitant as she stumbled through a sentence in English at the cash register. A Winnie the Pooh journal. These are the things I remember when I think of when my mom and I immigrated to America.  I was almost 7 at the time. born in Havana. Cuba. My papa is puro Mexicano and we lived back and forth between the heat of Havana and the concrete jungle of Mexico City. I didn't realize it then. but. boy. does it hit me now. I realize how scary it must have been for them. For my mom to leave the streets of Havana where our neighbors were our friends. where we gathered every holiday to eat pork and my grandma's rice and beans. to not hear the malecon and the heartbeat of her city pulsing with every crash of the wave. For my Dad to leave behind his four brothers and sisters. the memory of his parents. the street vendors selling the elotes con mayonesa that I would beg him to get in the mornings before school. the best friends he'd grown up with . . . everything. To decide to start from the ground up.  With a couple hundred dollars. the clothes on our backs. no family in the United States. and no clue of what was going to happen next. that's exactly what we did. Like my mom said. "I don't know where I'm going. but I can't stay here." And that was enough.  Why were we packing up our stuff? Why was my grandma hugging me tighter than usual? Where were we going? "We're going to Disney World!" That's what my Mom told me when we were crossing the border. She packed a little backpack with my Winnie the Pooh journal and my doll. and we crossed the border from Mexico to the US. seeing my Dad become an ant in the distance as he stayed behind.  Just Disney World. Whenever I have to make a decision now and I'm afraid. my mom always reminds me of that day. "That day. I knew if I thought about it. fear would make me turn back. That's why when you're afraid. you force yourself to jump. You don't think. you just jump." she says to me.  After she sat down with the immigration officer in a tiny office. we and a bunch of people from other countries with similar hopes were placed in rooms with tiny beds in them. a hotel full of these rooms. It was me and my mom and two other families in a little room waiting for somebody to come in and let us know if we were going to be granted permission to enter the US or be sent back. Some people spent days there. some spent weeks in agonizing anxiety over what the answer would be. Meanwhile. I was wondering when the heck we were going to get to Disney. We were there only a day when we finally got the news. The room bursted with joy. everybody around me clapping and hugging and screaming and crying! And me yelling out "Yay! We're all going to Disney!" Little did I know.  Little me and my mama ended up on a Greyhound bus to Miami that took 36 hours -- that's where I have my most vivid memories. Other stuff I vaguely remember and know from stories my parents told me years after. But I remember writing in my Winnie the Pooh journal a lot on that bus ride.  We got to Miami and moved into my grandpa's colleague's house who later became my godmother. My mom was a very good architect in Cuba. but when she came to America none of the degrees she earned in Cuba counted. so to make enough to keep us fed and put me into school she began stacking shoes in Marshalls and going to school at night to take courses in English. all while taking me to and from school and helping me with my homework all by herself. alone in a strange country. I can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for her to have worked her whole life in architecture and then have it all erased when she came here.  One day. as if God was listening. two elderly Cuban women were conversing with her and told her: "Oye. tu estas muy bonita para trabajar en Marshalls. Where are you from?" My mom told her the story of how she was Cuban and she was actually an architect. You wouldn't believe it. but the two Cuban women said they had a brother who worked in architecture and needed someone who worked in Autocad. a complicated architectural computer program. They asked her: "Do you know Autocad?" Internally. my mom was like "Autocad? What the hell is Autocad? We use pencil and paper where I'm from." But to the ladies. she said: "Autocad? Of course. Yes. of course. I can do that." She learned how to use the program in a week and made enough to move us out of my godmother's house and into an apartment.  She learned fast because she literally had to in order to survive. Immigrants have one thing in common: Hunger. I don't mean it literally. although that's true too. but metaphorically. The hunger to do the impossible because you have no choice. because you came too damn far. because you've known what struggling is. and you're not going to take an opportunity for granted. The hunger and ability to win above people with better circumstances than you simply because you want it badly enough.  Long story short. my papa came over from Mexico a year and a half later -- I had a little calendar in my room counting down the days -- because he couldn't stand being away from us. He went through such hardship to cross the Mexican border and had it harder than my mom and I did. literally risking his life for his family to physically make it here. When he first came to the US. he started off washing cars in front of Dolphin Mall in the blistering Miami heat. But we kept moving on up . . . with the Latin community in Miami. helping each other up as we did it. Slowly and slowly my parents kept working and climbing and ended up forming a construction company together named after my sister and I. They always pushed me to focus on my studies because the whole reason we came here was so my sister and I could have better opportunities in life than they did. They said: "Money comes and goes. but your education. lo que tienes aqui (and they would point to my head while saying that). nobody can ever take that away from you." They let me know that in order to go a good college I had to get a scholarship. so I worked as hard as I could. However -- plot twist! -- that didn't quite go the way we thought it would.  You see. in 9th grade. a little girl who had never sung in front of people before asked her parents if they could take her to Greensboro. NC. to audition for a little show called The X Factor. Yikes! I had never sang in front of people before. Well. did my mom know Autocad? No. Did I know how to perform on a stage on TV? No. But I wanted it badly enough. and I learned from my family that if you work hard enough and you want it badly enough. you can do the impossible.  I was wrong about one thing. My mama and papa did not leave everything behind. they brought it with them. My grandma still makes pork and rice and beans every holiday like she did. and my mom still feels the waves of the malecon in her heartbeat because she still feels the most at peace when she's by the sea. My grandma and dad still get drunk and sing Luis Miguel in the kitchen. We found our favorite Taco spot in Miami (I capitalized Taco because they are that good). And whenever we find another person from our country. we freak out. "?De que parte?" Because we have home in us. Because we brought it with us. Every Cuban brought it with them and so we have Miami. Mexicans brought it and so we have the best Mexican food ever. The Italians brought it and so we have pizza. The Swedish brought it and we have great pop songs. The list goes on and on. And so. that's why when I hear a bigoted. racist man with power and influence speak with anger and ill-will about immigrants. I think "what a fool."  I am so proud to be Cuban-Mexican. This country was built on immigrants. People who were brave enough to start over. How strong we are to leave behind everything we know in hopes of something better. We are not fearless. we just have dreams bigger than our fears. We jump. We run. We swim. we move mountains. we do whatever it takes. And so next time. when anybody wants to tell you they want to build a "wall" on our border. remember behind that wall is struggle. determination. hunger. Behind that wall. could be the next cure for cancer. the next scientist. the next artist. the next drummer. the next anything they work hard enough to become!  P.S. I did end up going to Disney for the first time a year later.

Camila Cabello,What Do I Know About Love?,What do I know about love? Nothing Where does the love go when it runs out? When does it leave? Why does it die? Do you kill it in one violent blow? Or is it a million unattended. unhealed little cuts and scratches? What do I know about love? Everything It creeps into my chest. uninvited and untameable I know love has no mercy on anyone. rich. poor. independent codependent. confident. insecure It'll bring you to your knees - if you did it right What I know for sure about love is that you never come out of it the same The other person is a chemical and I am a chemical and we both will come out as different people than when we met I know when you're in love. kissing is everything Because words aren't the only way to tell someone how you feel I know when you fall in love you feel like you're the first and only two people in the world Every kiss. every touch. every caress is like something you feel nobody has ever felt before And you think - has everybody that's fallen in love before just walked around this nonchalantly the whole time? You're at a restaurant with your friends and you can feel it. this secret under your tongue Burning like fire But sweet And it creeps up to your cheeks and makes you smile And suddenly you look down and you see your heart's veins reaching. reaching. clinging to someone else's heart I've learned a lot about love in my 20s. but not enough to maintain any control in the face of its power And for every new thing I learned. there was something else I couldn't understand All I know is love changes you If you're lucky. to something better What I know for sure is falling in love with life itself makes an artist out of everyone I thought I was making art before Writing songs was me making art but... Now I want my life to be the work of art And my songwriting to be the camera that I take a picture of it with It's what I'm living That's the art What do I know about love? Maybe nothing And that's why it's everything

I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability In all probability  It's a long shot. but I say why not If I say forget it. I know that I'll regret it It's a long shot just to beat the odds The chance is we won't make it But I know if I don't take it. there's no chance 'Cause you're the best I've got So take a long shot  I realize that there is all this doubting Things we're both scared about that We'll never see 'em coming. throw caution to the wind and We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop  My heartbeat beats me senselessly Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?

I know that I'll regret it It's a long shot just to beat the odds The chance is we won't make it But I know if I don't take it. there's no chance 'Cause you're the best I got So take a long shot  You didn't expect this Oh. you never saw me coming You didn't expect this Oh. you never saw this coming I take the long shot I take the long shot. shot. shot. shot. shot. shot 'Cause you're the best I've got Oh.

I'm a holy woman I know what it's like to give life to a being without ever needing to press skin against one another I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye I'm afraid you're under the impression That I was made to please you I was under the impression you understood me better The truth is. I'm a superwoman And some days I'm an angry woman And some days I'm a crazy woman For still waiting. for still loving harder even if I'm aching For still trusting that I'm still worth the most For still searching for someone to understand me better
Kehlani,Piece of Mind,To be honest. I think we spend so much time Trying to find answers for things And maybe it's just not meant to be answered I think sometimes the best things Are in the unplanned and the unknown And sometimes when we balance back and we do it We don't know how we did it. we just do it It's something in us. whether that's our intuition Whether that's the way we been raised Whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies Do you get it? So I think--I think that can remain a mystery And I think that's okay for it to remain a mystery Does that make sense?  Tryna forget all of the messages Tryna forget all of the stressin' 'Cause damn it was (extra and--) Tryna forget all of the secondary Feelings I had. man. it was fuckin' scary Tryna get back to all my old ways Tryna get back to all the hobbies From my old days (gettin' back) Tryna forget all the unnecessary Thoughts from my head. man. it was pretty scary  At least I learned a thing or two about me and you What we went through. it made me who I am (I am. I am) I can feel again. won't be numb again (numb) At least I didn't mess it up. that was all your touch I don't miss it much. but it made me who I am (I am.

I am) I can feel again. won't be numb again (numb) At least I didn't mess it up. that was all your touch I don't miss it much but it made me who I am (I am. I am) I can feel again. won't be dumb again (dumb)  Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind A piece of mind that I can't get right (I can't get it right) Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind A piece of mind. my heart's on my side (My heart is on my side)  On my side. yeah On my side. yeah Gotta get a little piece of mind Gotta make sure that it feels just right Gotta make sure that I'll make it last this time  Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind (I'm tryna break off) A piece of mind that I can't get right (Mind that I can't get) Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind (A piece of my mind) A piece of mind. my heart's on my side (My heart's on my side) (My heart's on my side--yeah. yeah)

Kehlani,Intro (You Should Be Here),Phone rings  Grandpa: Princess. belated Valentine's day Kehlani: Happy belated Valentine's day. what are you doing? Grandpa: What am I doing? Where are you? Kehlani: I'm in the studio Grandpa: You're in the studio... New York? Studio LA? Studio Atlanta? Studio here? Kehlani: Studio in LA Grandpa: In LA? Princess when do I get to see you? You know you are my granddaughter. You are like my daughter. Come on now Kehlani: I know Grandpa: Don't [?] out to the curb. I know you're the star on top of stars and everybody every day has to remind me. Do you know who Kehlani is? Do you know who your granddaughter is? I know who she is and I know who she was  They say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And as much as anyone can say how invincible I seem or how fearless I am or how brave I must be. I'm still human. And I've seen things and I've felt more pain than some will in their entire lives. all before the age of even being able to buy a fucking drink at a bar. But I have to be strong. not for myself but for a greater purpose. because I feel like my duty is far beyond me. you know? Beyond saving my family. It's for the world because somebody out there really needs to hear this. So to anybody who isn't here to see how far I've gone or how far I've yet to go. To family members that didn't make it or friends I lost along the way. Or maybe someone I gave my heart to that didn't know what to do with it. You should be here

Baby. just let me explore you And I'm not trying to hurt you By not accepting the things you wanna do I'm just trying to show you That I'm in it with my heart We could be dead broke as long as we're together I'm not leaving you. no matter the weather Cause I might be in love with you  Anyone can buy me anything Any man can buy me Any gold. some cars. a ring Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey  Don't be scared Don't be shy Stop looking down at your wallet I'm trying to see your eyes Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do All I need is for your love to be raw and true Edit the description to add: Historical context: what album the song's on. how popular it was An explanation of the overall story (e.g. "In this song. Eminem corresponds with a crazed fan who...") The sample used for a beat Edit

Halsey,​clementine,I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue. it's violent rain And in my world. the people on the street don't know my name In my world. I'm seven feet tall And the boys always call. and the girls do too Because in my world. I'm constantly. constantly havin' a breakthrough (Hmm) Or a breakdown. or a blackout Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?  'Cause I don't need anyone I don't need anyone I just need everyone and then some I don't need anyone I don't need anyone I just need everyone and then some  Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?

Halsey,100 Letters,Well.

Halsey,Badlands Story Prologue,Hello. and I'm sorry. A salutation and a farewell. I don't have much time.  This Times New Roman is gonna fly through my fingertips. like a plague of moths. The hollow black letter shells crunched into the ground like the skin of a cicada. This is all that's left. And you can do whatever you want with it. Keep it to yourself. or let it serve as a warning.  This city is disgusting; a corpse of what it used to be. The people are filthy. gluttonous. Ruled by the power exchange of sex from the hands of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie. The tops of the skylines buzz with the lackluster enthusiasm. The ground level is caked in dirt and rust and grime. and the people that dwell there awake and rub the filmy layer off their lukewarm eyes.  There are some here I love. some who fear me. and some who wish I was dead. I didn't ask for this; no one asks for this. You're born into it. You grow up oblivious and sheltered and one day the evil realities of this place hit you square between the eyes like a perfectly aimed bullet. If this were a movie. I would ride off in some blood red sunset down a stretch of desert road into the wasteland that keeps us captive here.  But this isn't a movie. these are the Badlands.

Halsey,A Story Like Mine,It's 2009 and I'm 14 and I'm crying Not really sure where I am but I'm holding the hand of my best friend Sam In the waiting room of a Planned Parenthood The air is sterile and clean. and the walls are that not grey. but green And the lights are so bright they could burn a whole through the seam of my jeans And my phone is buzzing in the pocket My mom is asking me if I remembered my keys 'cause she's closing the door and she needs to lock it But I can't tell my mom where I've gone I can't tell anyone at all You see. my best friend Sam was raped by a man that we knew 'cause he worked in the after-school program And he held her down with her textbooks beside her And he covered her mouth and he came inside her So now I'm with Sam. at the place with a plan. waiting for the results of a medical exam And she's praying she doesn't need an abortion. she couldn't afford it And her parents would. like. totally kill her  It's 2002 and my family just moved and the only people I know are my mom's friend. Sue. and her son He's got a case of Matchbox cars and he says that he'll teach me to play the guitar if I just keep quiet And the stairwell beside Apartment 1245 will haunt me in my sleep for as long as I am alive And I'm too young to know why it aches in my thighs. but I must lie. I must lie  It's 2012 and I'm dating a guy and I sleep in his bed and I just learned how to drive And he's older than me and he drinks whiskey neat and he's paying for everything This adult thing is not cheap We've been fighting a lot. almost 10 times a week And he wants to have sex. and I just want to sleep But he says I can't say no to him This much I owe to him He buys my dinner. so I have to blow him He's taken to forcing me down on my knees And I'm confused 'cause he's hurting me while he says please And he's only a man. and these things he just needs He's my boyfriend. so why am I filled with unease?  It's 2017 and I live like a queen And I've followed damn near every one of my dreams I'm invincible and I'm so fucking naive I believe I'm protected 'cause I live on a screen Nobody would dare act that way around me I've earned my protection. eternally clean Until a man that I trust gets his hands in my pants But I don't want none of that. I just wanted to dance And I wake up the next morning like I'm in a trance and there's blood Is that my blood? H-hold on a minute  You see I've worked every day since I was 18 I've toured everywhere from Japan to Mar-a-Lago I even went on stage that night in Chicago when I was having a miscarriage I mean. I pied the piper. I put on a diaper And sang out my spleen to a room full of teens What do you mean this happened to me? You can't put your hands on me You don't know what my body has been through I'm supposed to be safe now I earned it  It's 2018 and I've realized nobody is safe long as she is alive And every friend that I know has a story like mine And the world tells me we should take it as a compliment But then heroes like Ashley and Simone and Gabby. McKayla and Gaga. Rosario. Aly Remind me this is the beginning. it is not the finale And that's why we're here And that's why we rally It's Olympians and a medical resident and not one fucking word from the man who is President It's about closed doors and secrets and legs and stilletos from the Hollywood hills to the projects in ghettos When babies are ripped from the arms of teen mothers and child brides cry globally under the covers Who don't have a voice on the magazine covers They tell us take cover  But we are not free until all of us are free So love your neighbor. please treat her kindly Ask her her story and then shut up and listen Black. Asian. poor. wealthy. trans. cis. Muslim. Christian Listen. listen and then yell at the top of your lungs Be a voice for all those who have prisoner tongues For the people who had to grow up way too young There is work to be done There are songs to be sung Lord knows there's a war to be won

Halsey,2018 Blossom Ball Acceptance Speech,Well. as you guys obviously heard from Subrata De and  Sandra Gelbard. I gave a speech a couple of months ago at the women's march which means I am the speech girl now. So I hope you weren't expecting something too eloquent because I am winging this one as it is very close to my heart.  When I was 20 years old. I was just starting out as a musician and I was in the time of my life when everything was kind of make-it-or-break-it and one night I was in Chicago. I was playing The Vic Theater and I was doing an event for Vevo. which is a really large social media platform. 33 million impressions which is a number I will never forget. because that night in Chicago. I had a miscarriage. I was 20 years old. I didn't even know I was pregnant and I had a miscarriage. I remember laying in a bed in a hotel room with a towel between my legs. bleeding and staring at my very young. very scared. very male managers who had no idea what was going on and I remember them looking at me and saying. "I mean. it's 33 million impressions. this concert is kind of a big deal." So. I had a choice to make in that moment which was. whether I was going to let this experience play out the way it was probably supposed to. or if I was going to get out there and go on that stage. So I took a Percocet and put on an adult incontinence diaper and I wore a long t-shirt that would cover it and I got on stage and I performed in front of about 1.200 screaming teenage girls. There's videos of it online. if you want to go watch.  It was in that moment that I realized that part of being a woman and dealing with reproductive health is being treated like you're not a human. is being treated like you're a robot and you're supposed to wake up every day and get over it. But it was also in that moment that I realized that I could overcome anything and that if I wanted to pursue this career and I wanted this pursue this path. there was absolutely nothing that was going to get in my fucking way. excuse my language.  I went to Planned Parenthood after because I was 20 years old and I was a struggling musician and we don't make a lot of money when you're 20 years old and a struggling musician. Planned Parenthood was the only place that I knew that was safe. that I knew I could trust. that I could be treated like a person and given options and information and that is where I went. Shout out Planned Parenthood. And the biggest question was. why me at 20 years old? Perfectly healthy. able body. why would I have a miscarriage? And it was in that process that I found out that I had endometriosis and I had had painful periods my whole life. But it was something that I was kind of told was just something that women in our family deal with. I was told I was sensitive or over dramatic. I remember when I had my first job as a hostess at a restaurant and I remember clearing a table and taking a tray back into the kitchen and collapsing to the floor and rushing to the hospital and there was a lot of misdiagnoses along the way. PCOS. which I am sure a lot of people are familiar with as well but nobody really knew what was going on until I had that miscarriage.  And it was shortly after that I met my current OB-GYN who is Dr. Aliabadi. out in LA and she is really. really incredible and she is one of my best friends because we see a lot of each other [laughs]. I didn't know what was going on when I got my diagnosis and I had spent a lifetime tucking my tampons into the sleeve of my sweatshirt when I would go to the bathroom. god forbid anybody knew that I was menstruating because it was like the most shameful thing of all time. And now there was this. So. you take the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a woman. which is having a period. and you make it worse and that is a really tough pill to swallow.  I was 21 and was realizing that there is a possibility that I wouldn't be able to have kids and I spoke about it. I told my fans what I was going through about my diagnosis. I implored them to speak with their physicians and that if they were going through painful menstrual cycles. they needed to speak up because it's not normal to be having such pain. If you're staying home from work. if you're staying home from school. that is not normal and you need to speak up and you need to ask your physicians to take you seriously. And what happened afterwards was kind of amazing. Because hundreds. maybe even thousands of young people started coming to my concerts and coming to my meet and greets and telling me that because I drew their attention to endometriosis they were diagnosed and people were catching this disease and young people who were 16. 17. 18 years old. which means there was so much hope for them. There was hope for them to not live a life that was not full of pain and this was something they wouldn't have known about if I didn't post a tweet one day.  And it seemed so simple but it was a scary thing to do because as soon as I did it. oh boy. did the world flock in. Everyone wanted to know. who was the father of the baby that I miscarried. was I ever going to be able to have kids. does this mean I was infertile. what is endometriosis. Everyone just wanted to pick and pick and pick apart of me and I was already feeling very. very vulnerable. Part of endometriosis is that it can feel like a direct attack on your womanhood. I was very fatigued and was fainting backstage at my concerts and I was bleeding and I was pissed off at the whole world. I was like. why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this? My god! Just because I had sex before marriage. this is what I get. seriously? Because I will take it all back. I really will.  But in the process of having everyone pick me apart and feeling so insecure. feeling less of a woman 'cause I couldn't be intimate with my boyfriend. because I couldn't go out when my friends wanted me to. because I was dealing with digestion problems. and bleeding problems and fainting and all of the other amazing things that come along with having endo. It was really hard to feel like that confident. 20 something-year-old girl who wanted to get on the stage with her middle finger held high and make everyone sing along with her. I had surgery a year ago in January and since then. I have felt a lot better. I really have. I had the laparoscopic diagnostic surgery and endometriosis ablation. And I walked the red carpet at the Grammy's with stitches in my stomach. There is that. And I have made a lot of friends now that I am able to go out and do stuff. I am in a new relationship with someone that loves me and understands me and is passionate and caring about what I have gone through but I still wake up every day and I am scared that if I become that sick girl again that all of those people will go away. That fear. it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life. that if I get sick again. if I get bad like I was. that my friends aren't going to understand. that my partner is not going to understand. that everybody is going to give up on me because I am a lot easier to deal with when I am healthy than I am when I am sick.  But it's being places like here and hearing the stories of other women who have been through what I have been through and seeing the smiles on their face and watching them walk in beautiful dresses. And watching them be here with their children. their miracle children that they are so happy to have. It's these experiences that give me hope and make me proud to be sharing my story and knowing that because I am talking about it and because I am not ashamed of it. and because I am proud of it that more women are in this world hopefully can catch their diagnosis early or wake up one day and realize that the pain they're living with is not normal and that hopefully they can live a pain free life because of it. And I hope that more attention will come to research. to treatment because 1 in 10 women is way too fucking many.  You have to forgive me. I'm emotional and also obviously very hormonal so. I knew I was going to cry. I am really lucky. I get on stage every night in a little white costume mind you and I work my ass off and to any of my fans and friends and people listening to me who may not know anything about me or never heard a song. if you're struggling with endometriosis or any chronic illness for that matter. you need to know it's not something that it's not something that makes you weak. It's a battle that you've overcome and every battle that you're in helps you win the war at the end of the day. Keep talking to your friends. keep supporting your loved ones. to the women in your life. make sure that they don't feel ashamed to talk about their reproductive rights. to talk about their reproductive experiences. because the only way for this--for us to gain control of this--is to speak about it. I am so honored to be here and to be supporting my endo sisters in the room. around the world. I can't thank you guys enough. Keep fucking fighting.

I remember that night. I just might I remember that night. I just might I remember that night. I remember that--  I remember that night. I just might Regret that night for the rest of my days I remember those soldier boys Tripping over themselves to win our praise I remember that dreamlike candlelight Like a dream that you can't quite place But Alexander. I'll never forget the first Time I saw your face I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame And when you said "Hi." I forgot my dang name Set my heart aflame. ev'ry part aflame This is not a game...  You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied I'm sure I don't know what you mean. you forget yourself You're like me. I've never been satisfied Is that right? I have never been satisfied My name's Angelica Schuyler Alexander Hamilton Where's your fam'ly from? Unimportant. there's a million things I haven't done Just you wait. just you wait...

It's The feeling of freedom. of seein' the light It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it. right? The conversation lasted two minutes. maybe three minutes Ev'rything we said in total agreement. it's A dream and it's a bit of a dance A bit of a posture. it's a bit of a stance He's a bit of a flirt. but I'm 'a give him a chance I asked about his fam'ly. did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting. he looked askance He's penniless. he's flying by the seat of his pants  Handsome. boy. does he know it! Peach fuzz. and he can't even grow it! I wanna take him far away from this place Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is  Helpless And I know she is Helpless And her eyes are just Helpless And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time  I'm a girl in a world in which My only job is to marry rich My father has no sons so I'm the one Who has to social climb for one Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious And Alexander is penniless Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less  (Doesn't mean I want him any less) (Doesn't mean I want him any less) (Doesn't mean I want him any less)  He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister And that elevates his status. I'd Have to be naive to set that aside Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza Now that's his bride Nice going. Angelica. he was right You will never be satisfied  (I will never be satisfied) (I will never be satisfied)  I know my sister like I know my own mind You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned He'd be mine She would say. "I'm fine" But she'd be lying  But when I fantasize at night It's Alexander's eyes As I romanticize what might have been If I hadn't sized him up so quickly At least my dear Eliza's his wife At least I keep his eyes in my life...  To the groom! (To the groom. to the groom. to the groom) To the bride! (To the bride. to the bride. to the bride) From your sister (Angelica. Angelica. Angelica) Who is always by your side (By your side. by your side) To your union and the hope that you provide (You provide. you provide)  May you always Be satisfied And I know (yeah) She'll be happy as his bride And I know He will never be satisfied I will never be satisfied

Lana Del Rey,Ride Monologue,I was in the winter of my life And the men I met along the road were my only summer At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me And my only real happy times  I was a singer Not a very popular one I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky That I wished on over and over again. sparkling and broken But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is  When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living. they asked me why. but there's no use in talking to people who have a home They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people For home to be wherever you lie your head  I was always an unusual girl My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul No moral compass pointing due north No fixed personality Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying  Because I was born to be the other woman Who belonged to no one Who belonged to everyone Who had nothing Who wanted everything With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me   Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people And finally I did On the open road We had nothing to lose. nothing to gain. nothing we desired anymore Except to make our lives into a work of art  Live fast Die young Be wild And have fun  I believe in the country America used to be I believe in the person I want to become I believe in the freedom of the open road And my motto is the same as ever "I believe in the kindness of strangers"  And when I'm at war with myself I ride I just ride  Who are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?  I have I am fucking crazy But I am free

Florence + The Machine,South London Forever,When I go home alone I drive past the place where I was born And the places where I used to drink Young and drunk and stumbling in the street Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet With the art students and the boys in bands High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met  I thought. "It doesn't get better than this There can be nothing better than this. better than this."  And we climbed onto the roof of the museum And someone made love in the grass And I forgot my name And the way back to my mother's house With your Blackpool eyes and your bitten lips The world is at your fingertips  It doesn't get better than this What else could be better than this?  Oh. do you know what I've seen? I have seen the fields aflame And everything I ever did Was just another way to scream your name  Over and over and over and over again Over and over and over and over again  And we're just children wanting children of our own I want  a space to watch things grow But did I dream too big? Do I have to let it go? And what if one day there is no such thing as snow? Oh God. what do I know?  And I don't know anything Except that green is so green And there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with spring  Oh. do you know what I have seen? I have seen the fields aflame But everything I ever did Was just another way to scream your name  Over and over and over and over again Over and over and over and over again  Oh. do you know what I've seen? I have seen the fields aflame But everything I ever did Was just another way to scream your name

I mean We was broke sharing jeans. now we on the big screen Heartbreakers We was the ones gettin' our hearts broke Open up my mind it's like God spoke He told me everything I needed to know The young concrete rose with no water to grow But now we in full bloom when we walk in the room People already know what we're tryin' to do. oh  We live in cities you'll never see onscreen Not very pretty. but we sure know how to run things Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams And you know we're on each other's team  I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air So there I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care So there  We live in cities you'll never see onscreen Not very pretty. but we sure know how to run things Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams And you know we're on each other's team  We're on each other's team And you know we're on each other's team We're on each other's team And you know and you know and you know
Lorde,Bravado (FFFRRANNNO Remix),All my life. I've been fighting a war I can't talk to you or your friends It's not only you My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to This will not do Cause I was raised up to be admired. to be noticed But when you're withdrawn. it's the closest thing to assault when all eyes are on you This will not do   I'm faking glory Lick my lips. toss my hair And turn the smile on And the story's brand new But I can take it from here I'll find my own bravado  It's a switch flipped. it's a pill tipped back. it's a moon eclipse And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your bloodstream. a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes It's a marathon run or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down To trip me up and laugh at me but I learned not to want the quiet of a room with no one around to find me out I want the applause. the approval. the things that make me go oh   [Chorus]
Lorde,Tumblr Post on Complex, Pitchfork,Bugs me how publications like complex will profile interesting artists in order to sell copies/get clicks and then shit on their records? it happens to me all the time- pitchfork and that ilk being like "can we interview you?" after totally taking the piss out of me in a review. have a stance on an artist and stick to it. don't act like you respect them then throw them under the bus
Lorde,Unreleased,The Chanel. the Dior and the Prada Take it home. make a fire in the garden Sundance kids. so godless One day it's gonna be not like this Black sand on all our beaches Witchcraft. split lip and a bee sting And what I really wanna know is  Do I look like a fool? 'Cause I must be a fool To hold on to precious metals like I do Do. I do To hold on to precious metals like I do I do. do  The Chanel. the Dior. and the Prada Give my best to the ones that are bothered Take a flight trip to Jakarta All the kids at the shows make it louder All of the feelings and all of the tears are going All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way I wish you would come back. didn't want to run back Come back. bet you want to come back And I'll find you  Do I look like a fool? 'Cause I must be a fool To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah) Do (ah). do (ah). do (ah) To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah) Do (ah). do (ah). do (ah)  Ah. ah. ah Ah. ah. ah Ah. ah. ah
Lorde,Team (Remix by JGRAMM Beats ),Call all the ladies out. they're in their finery A hundred jewels on throats A hundred jewels between teeth Now bring my boys in Their skin in craters like the moon The moon we love like a brother While he glows through the room Dancin' around the lies we tell Dancin' around big eyes as well. (oh) Even the comatose. they don't dance and tell  We live in cities you'll never see onscreen Not very pretty. but we sure know how to run things Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams And you know. we're on each other's team (team) (team) (team)  We're on each other's team (team) And you know. we're on each other's team (team) (team) (team) We're on each other's team (team) And you know. we're on each other's team  I'm kinda over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air So there I'm kinda older than I was when I reveled without a care So there  And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive 'Cause what this palace wants is release  We live in cities you'll never see onscreen Not very pretty. but we sure know how to run things Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams And you know. we're on each other's team (team) (team) (team)  We're on each other's team (team) And you know. we're on each other's team (team) (team) (team) We're on each other's team (team) And you know. we're on each other's team

Lorde,Life On Mars?,It's a God awful small affair To the girl with the mousey hair But her mummy is yelling: No! And her daddy has told her to go But her friend is no where to be seen Now she walks through her sunken dream To the seats with the clearest view And she's hooked to the silver screen But the film is sadd'ning bore For she's lived it ten times or more She could spit in the eyes of fools As they ask her to focus on  Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh man! Look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman Beating up the wrong guy Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know He's in the best selling show Is there life on Mars?  It's on America's tortured brow That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow Now the workers have struck for fame Cause Lennon's on sale again See the mice in their million hordes From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads Rule Britannia is out of bounds To my mother. my dog and clowns But the film is a sadd'ning bore Cause I wrote it ten times or more It's about to be writ again As I ask you to focus on  Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh man! Look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman Beating up the wrong guy Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know He's in the best selling show Is there life on Mars?

How can anybody have you and lose you And not lose their mind too?  The last days of the sunset superstars Girls in cages playing their guitars But how can I leave? I just follow the hood of my car In Los Ageless. the waves they never break They build and build until you don't have no escape But how can I leave? I just follow my hood to the sea. go to sleep  How can anybody have you? How can anybody have you and lose you? How can anybody have you and lose you And not lose their mind too? How can anybody have you? How can anybody have you and lose you? How can anybody have you and lose you And not lose their mind too?  Oh my Lola. we really did it now I'm a monster and you're my sacred cow Oh I can keep running No I can keep on running  How can anybody have you? How can anybody have you and lose you? How can anybody have you and lose you And not lose their mind too? How can anybody have you? How can anybody have you and lose you? How can anybody have you and lose you And not lose their mind?

Adele,Million Years Ago, I only wanted to have fun Learning to fly. learning to run I let my heart decide the way When I was young Deep down. I must have always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes. I'd have to pay And bare my soul  I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes. I just feel it's only me Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky. not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air. I miss my friends I miss my mother. I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago  When I walk around all of the streets Where I grew up and found my feet They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory But they don't recognize me now In the light of day  I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes. I just feel it's only me Who never became who they thought they'd be I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky. not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air. I miss my friends I miss my mother. I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago  A million years ago

Adele,I Found a Boy,I thought I told you. he'd be home soon Couldn't help myself. you're too good to be true I fall short each time. every time he ain't here You and your charm creep closer. closer and near Like a fool for fire. I fall. with my pride and all Like a bomb before explosion. ticking by your call You're the wiser one. disguised from greed And I'm just a child who longs on her knees  But I found a boy who I love more Than I ever did you before So stand beside the river I cried And lay yourself down Look how you want me now that I don't need you  So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees At the first sight of you crawling back to me To whisper. "Will you leave your man?" 'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me I won't stand by you  'Cause I found a boy who I love more Than I ever did you before So stand beside the river I cried And lay yourself down Look how you want me now that I don't need you  I ain't yours for no taking You must be mistaken I could never look into your eyes And settle for wrong and ignore the right  When I found a boy who loves me more Than you ever did before So stand beside the river you cried And lay yourself down Look how you want me now. but I don't need you
Adele,Best for Last,Wait. do you see my heart on my sleeve? It's been there for days on end And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours too Baby. come on now. I'm trying to tell you just how I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally Say that it's always been me  That's made you feel a way you've never felt before And I'm all you need and that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you  You should know that you're just a temporary fix This is not rooted with you. it don't mean that much to me You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me  Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest It turns out it ain't enough? You're still not mentioning love What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly? I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her And I think that I know things may never change I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say  I make you feel a way you've never felt before And I'm all you need and that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you  You should know that you're just a temporary fix This is not rooted with you. it don't mean that much to me You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me  But. despite the truth that I know I find it hard to let go and give up on you Seems I love the things you do Like the meaner you treat me. more eager I am To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around And I will do until I find myself with you  And make you feel a way you've never felt before And be all you need so that you never want more Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you
Adele,Right as Rain, Who wants to be right as rain? It's better when something is wrong You get excitement in your bones And everything you do's a game When night comes. and you're on your own You can say. "I chose to be alone" Who wants to be right as rain? It's harder when you're on top  'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired There ain't no room in my bed. as far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out And now I've had enough of love  Who wants to be riding high When you'll just crumble back on down? You give up everything you are And even then. you don't get far They make believe that everything Is exactly what it seems But at least when you're at your worst You know how to feel things  See. when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired There ain't no room in my bed. as far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out And now. I've had enough of (love)  Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again 'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then When we were both right. and no one had blame But now. I give up on this endless game  'Cause who wants to be right as rain? It's better when something is wrong I get excitement in my bones Even though everything's a strain When night comes. and I'm on my own You should know I chose to be alone Who wants to be right as rain? It's harder when you're on top  'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired There ain't no room in my bed. as far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out And now. I've had enough of--  No room in my bed. as far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up. I've cried my heart out And now. I've had enough of love
Adele,Need You Now,Picture perfect memories Scattered all around the floor Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore  And I wonder if I ever cross your mind For me it happens all the time  It's a quarter after one. I'm all alone and I need you now Said I wouldn't call. but I lost all control and I need you now And I don't know how I can do without.

I'm little drunk and I need you now Said I wouldn't call. but I lost all control and I need you now And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now  Yes.

I owe them Swept away. I'm stolen  Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall At Skyfall  Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my number You can take my name But you'll never have my heart  Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall  Where you go I go What you see I see I know I'd never be me Without the security Of your loving arms Keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand And we'll stand  Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall Let the sky fall We will stand tall At Skyfall
Adele,Chasing Pavements [Live at the Hotel Cafe],I've made up my mind Don't need to think it over If I'm wrong. I am right Don't need to look no further This ain't lust. I know this is love. but If I tell the world. I'll never say enough 'Cause it was not said to you And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you  Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste. even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere?  I build myself up and fly around in circles Waiting as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally. could this be it. or?  Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste. even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah  Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste. even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up. or should I just keep on chasing pavements? Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Oh. oh  Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere? Or would it be a waste. even if I knew my place? Should I leave it there? Should I give up. or should I just keep chasing pavements Even if it leads nowhere?
Adele,That’s It, I Quit, I’m Moving On [Live at the Hotel Cafe],When we used to say goodnight I'd always kiss and hold you tight But lately you don't seem to care You close the door and leave me standing there  Oh. honey That's not fair That's it. I quit. I'm movin' on  The other night we had a date And you showed up two hours late And though your hair was all in place Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face  Oh. they smeared it every place Yeah that's it honey I quit I'm movin' on Oooohhhh  You made me want you You made me leave you You made me tumble and fall But if I can't have you the way I want you I don't want you at all  Baby. I can take a lot 'Cause I love everything you got Though your kisses fill me So if you got someone else I gotta go  Oh. that you know Yeah that's it honey I quit I'm movin' on  Oooohhhh  You made me want you You made me leave you You made me tumble and fall But if I can't have you the way I want you I don't want you at all  Baby.

Adele,Right as Rain [Live at the Hotel Cafe],Who wants to be right as rain It's better when something is wrong You get excitement in your bones And everything you do's a game  When night comes and your all on your own You can say I chose to be alone Who want to be right as rain It's harder when your on top  'Cause when hard work don't pay off And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed As far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up I've cried my heart out And now I've had enough of love  Who wants to be riding high When you'll just crumble back on down You give up everything you are And even then you don't get far  They make believe that everything Is exactly what it seems But at least when your at your worst You know how to feel things  See when hard work don't pay off And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed As far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up I've cried my heart out And now I've had enough of love  Go ahead and still my heart To make me cry again 'Cause it will never hurt As much as it did then  When we were both right And no one had blame But now I give up On this endless game  'Cause who wants to be right as rain It's better when something is wrong I get excitement in your bones Even thought everything's a strain  When night comes and I'm all on my own You should know I chose to be alone So who want to be right as rain It's harder when your on top  'Cause when hard work don't pay off And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed As far as I'm concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won't be making up I've cried my heart out And now I've had enough of love

I think I am finally clean (Oh. oh. oh. oh)  There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh. oh-oh) When the butterflies turned to Dust that covered my whole room So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh. oh-oh) Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you  The water filled my lungs.

Taylor Swift,Why She Disappeared [Poem],When she fell. she fell apart. Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed. her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends  When she looked around. her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: "Whatever you say. it is not right." "Whatever you do. it is not enough." "Your kindness is fake." "Your pain is manipulative."  When she lay there on the ground. She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something. Not just the idea of something.  When she finally rose. she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises. Charmers. dandies and get-love-quick-schemes  When she stood. she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark. wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something. not just the idea of something.  When she turned to go home. She heard the echoes of new words "May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice" And even louder: "without your past. you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally. By design or some violent. exquisite happenstance ...here."  And in the death of her reputation. She felt truly alive.
Taylor Swift,You Belong with Me,You're on the phone with your girlfriend. she's upset She's going off about something that you said 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do I'm in the room. it's a typical Tuesday night I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like And she'll never know your story like I do  But she wears short skirts.

Taylor Swift,State of Grace,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know. is touch and go We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds. or fades in time  And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same  You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannon ball Now all we know. is don't let go We are alone. just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs. four blue eyes  So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (never) be the same  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate You're my Achilles heel This is the golden age of something good And right and real  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (never) be the same  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong) Be the same (We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild)  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,Reputation [Prologue],Here's something I've learned about people.  We think we know someone. but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light. but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate. who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet. a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd. nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.  This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet. and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately. we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up. look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes. and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future. their partner. their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story. all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.  The point being. despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life. humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves. our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party. existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity. loyalty and self-preservation. pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful. lovely side of that. I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving. vibrant people. On the other side of the coin. my mistakes have been used against me. my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment. and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.  When this album comes out. gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song. as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory. because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it. it couldn't have happened right?  Let me say it again. louder for those in the back...  We think we know someone. but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.  There will be no further explanation. There will be just reputation.
Taylor Swift,If You’re Anything Like Me [Poem],If you're anything like me. You bite your nails. And laugh when you're nervous. You promise people the world. because that's what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling. you need to stop.  If you're anything like me. You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers. hold your breath. Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace. to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now. Darling. it scares you.  If you're anything like me. You never wanted to lock your door. Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling. now you have to.  If you're anything like me. There's a justice system in your head For names you'll never speak again. And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you. In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling. there is where you meet yourself.  If you're anything like me You've grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling. you keep trying.  If you're anything like me. You couldn't recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling. later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day.  If you're anything like me. I'm sorry.  But Darling. it's going to be okay.

Taylor Swift,Dear John,Long were the nights when My days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor won't fall through... again My mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine You paint me a blue sky Then go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed the rules everyday Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone. tonight Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why  Dear John. I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda' known  Well maybe it's me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said "Run as fast as you can"  Dear John. I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John. I see it all now. it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young To be played by your dark. twisted games When I loved you so? I shoulda' known  You are an expert at sorry And keeping the lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches Before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks Over your sad empty town. yeah Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh  Dear John. I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress Wrote you a song. you shoulda' known You shoulda' known Don't you think I was too young? You shoulda' known

I watched it begin again  You said you never met one girl who Had as many James Taylor records as you. but I do We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy. but I do  But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe.

Taylor Swift,Beautiful Ghosts,Follow me home if you dare to I wouldn't know where to lead you Should I take chances when no one took chances on me? So I watch from the dark. wait for my life to start With no beauty in my memory  All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets. alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something. something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts  Perilous night. their voices calling A flicker of light before the dawning Out here. the wild ones are taming the fear within me Scared to call them my friends and be broken again Is this hope just a mystical dream?  All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets. alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something. something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts  And so maybe my home isn't what I had known What I thought it would be But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night And I know that this life isn't safe. but it's wild and it's free  All that I wanted was to be wanted I'll never wander London streets. alone and haunted Born into nothing With them. I have something. something to cling to I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
Taylor Swift,Mine,You were in college. working part-time. waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk. with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love. if it never lasts  I say. "Can you believe it?" As we're lying on the couch The moment. I could see it Yes. yes. I can see it now  Do you remember. we were sitting there. by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Flash forward. and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes. yes This is what I thought about:  Do you remember. we were sitting there. by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  And I remember that fight. 2:30 AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out. crying. and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then. you took me by surprise You said. "I'll never leave you alone."  You said. "I remember how we felt. sitting by the water And every time I look at you. it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine" Hold on. make it last Hold on. never turn back You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Yeah. yeah Do you believe it?

I haven't seen them in a while You've been good. busier than ever We small talk. work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why  Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses. and I left them there to die  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you. saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  I'd go back to December. turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time  These days. I haven't been sleeping Staying up. playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer. all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall  And then the cold came The dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love. and all I gave you was goodbye  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you. saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  I'd go back to December. turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  I miss your tan skin. your sweet smile So good to me. so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again. I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it. but I can't So if the chain is on your door. I understand  But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you. saying I'm sorry for that night And I'd go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  I'd go back to December. turn around and make it alright I'd go back to December. turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  All the time

"I love you" Just bein' in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true Baby. yeah  And when I'm feelin' alone You remind me of home Oh. baby. baby.

"I need you" And for the first time. I had something to lose And I guess we fell apart in the usual way And the story's got dust on every page But sometimes. I wonder how you think about it now And I see your face in every crowd  'Cause darling. it was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground  Tonight. I'm gonna dance For all that we've been through But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you Tonight. I'm gonna dance Like you were in this room But I don't wanna dance If I'm not dancing with you  It was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground  Tonight.

Taylor Swift,Long Live,I said. remember this moment. in the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew our lives Would never be the same You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age  Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming. long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day. we will be remembered  I said. remember this feeling I passed the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town And the cynics were outraged Screaming. "This is absurd" 'Cause for a moment. a band of thieves In ripped up jeans got to rule the world  Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming. long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming. long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day. we will be remembered  Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall  Will you take a moment? Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if. God forbid. fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell them my name Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life. with you  Long. long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming. long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid Singing. long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long. long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day. we will be remembered

'cause right now. you're mine  And you'll say Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high. the water's rough But this love is ours  And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong And your hands are tough. but they are where mine belong And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith With this song for you  'Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos Will be ignored 'Cause my heart is yours  So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine But they can't take what's ours They can't take what's ours  The stakes are high. the water's rough But this love is ours
Taylor Swift,I Knew You Were Trouble (Intro),I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes. you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories. it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did. it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again. but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. but I just thought. how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him. it was losing me.
