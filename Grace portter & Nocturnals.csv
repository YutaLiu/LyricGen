Grace Potter & The Nocturnals,Stars,I lit a fire with the love you left behind And it burned wild and crept up the mountain side I followed your ashes into outer space I can't look out the window. I can't look at this place  I can't look at the stars They make me wonder where you are Stars. up on Heaven's boulevard And if I know you at all. I know you've gone too far So I. I can't look at the stars  All those times we looked up at the sky Looking out so far. it felt like we could fly And now I'm all alone in the dark of night And the moon is shining. but I can't see the light  And I can't look at the stars They make me wonder where you are Stars. up on Heaven's boulevard And if I know you at all. I know you've gone too far So I. I can't look at the stars Stars Stars. they make me wonder where you are Stars. up on Heaven's boulevard And if I know you at all. I know you've gone too far So I can't look at the starsGrace Potter & The Nocturnals,Apologies,Yesterday. he said my eyes were fading fast away I said. "Well. what do you expect? You asked me not to stay And if it had all been for the best. I wouldn't feel this way" And he said  Oh he said it's crazy. how love stays with me You know it hurts me. 'cause I don't wanna fight this war And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene Of love and fear and apologies Apologies  My love is like a blanket that gets a little bit too warm sometimes I wanna wrap somebody in it who can hold me in his arms 'Cause when it got a little too hot in there He was always stepping out for air and he froze Oh. he froze  Oh he said it's crazy. how love stays with me. yeah You know it hurts me. 'cause I don't wanna fight this war And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene Of love and fear and apologies Apologies  Yesterday. he looked at me with a tear in his eye and said "I'll always tell you you're my friend. I hope I don't have to lie Cause it's clear you love another man" I said. "You're damn right" And he said. he said  Oh he said it's crazy. how love stays with me You know it hurts me. 'cause I don't wanna fight this war And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene Of love and fear and apologies  He says it's crazy how love stays with me. yeah You know it hurts me that I didn't figure it out before And now it's too late for a soliloquy It's way too late for dignity It's time for apologies. apologies Apologies. apologies
