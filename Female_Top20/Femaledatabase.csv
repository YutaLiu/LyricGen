I'm a holy woman I know what it's like to give life to a being without ever needing to press skin against one another I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye I'm afraid you're under the impression That I was made to please you I was under the impression you understood me better The truth is. I'm a superwoman And some days I'm an angry woman And some days I'm a crazy woman For still waiting. for still loving harder even if I'm aching For still trusting that I'm still worth the most For still searching for someone to understand me better
Kehlani,Piece of Mind,To be honest. I think we spend so much time Trying to find answers for things And maybe it's just not meant to be answered I think sometimes the best things Are in the unplanned and the unknown And sometimes when we balance back and we do it We don't know how we did it. we just do it It's something in us. whether that's our intuition Whether that's the way we been raised Whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies Do you get it? So I think--I think that can remain a mystery And I think that's okay for it to remain a mystery Does that make sense?  Tryna forget all of the messages Tryna forget all of the stressin' 'Cause damn it was (extra and--) Tryna forget all of the secondary Feelings I had. man. it was fuckin' scary Tryna get back to all my old ways Tryna get back to all the hobbies From my old days (gettin' back) Tryna forget all the unnecessary Thoughts from my head. man. it was pretty scary  At least I learned a thing or two about me and you What we went through. it made me who I am (I am. I am) I can feel again. won't be numb again (numb) At least I didn't mess it up. that was all your touch I don't miss it much. but it made me who I am (I am.

I needed no one else You tell me that I was worth a million smiles And tell me that I was worth a million miles And tryna make sure that I forget the times that You made me think that I just couldn't shine. yeah  At least I learned a thing or two about me and  you What we went through. it made me who I am (I am. I am) I can feel again. won't be numb again (numb) At least I didn't mess it up. that was all your touch I don't miss it much but it made me who I am (I am. I am) I can feel again. won't be dumb again (dumb)  Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind A piece of mind that I can't get right (I can't get it right) Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind A piece of mind. my heart's on my side (My heart is on my side)  On my side. yeah On my side. yeah Gotta get a little piece of mind Gotta make sure that it feels just right Gotta make sure that I'll make it last this time  Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind (I'm tryna break off) A piece of mind that I can't get right (Mind that I can't get) Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind (A piece of my mind) A piece of mind. my heart's on my side (My heart's on my side) (My heart's on my side--yeah. yeah)

Sia,Alive,I was born in a thunderstorm I grew up overnight I played alone.

I'm still breathing I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing I'm alive. I'm alive I'm alive. I'm alive  I found solace in the strangest place Way in the back of my mind I saw my life in a stranger's face And it was mine  I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go Where the wind don't change And nothing in the ground can ever grow No hope. just lies And you're taught to cry into your pillow But I survived  I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing I'm alive. I'm alive I'm alive.

I'll never forget the first Time I saw your face I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame And when you said "Hi." I forgot my dang name Set my heart aflame. ev'ry part aflame This is not a game...  You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied I'm sure I don't know what you mean. you forget yourself You're like me. I've never been satisfied Is that right?

His hands started fidgeting. he looked askance He's penniless. he's flying by the seat of his pants  Handsome. boy. does he know it! Peach fuzz. and he can't even grow it! I wanna take him far away from this place Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is  Helpless And I know she is Helpless And her eyes are just Helpless And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time  I'm a girl in a world in which My only job is to marry rich My father has no sons so I'm the one Who has to social climb for one Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious And Alexander is penniless Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less  (Doesn't mean I want him any less) (Doesn't mean I want him any less) (Doesn't mean I want him any less)  He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister And that elevates his status. I'd Have to be naive to set that aside Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza Now that's his bride Nice going. Angelica. he was right You will never be satisfied  (I will never be satisfied) (I will never be satisfied)  I know my sister like I know my own mind You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned He'd be mine She would say. "I'm fine" But she'd be lying  But when I fantasize at night It's Alexander's eyes As I romanticize what might have been If I hadn't sized him up so quickly At least my dear Eliza's his wife At least I keep his eyes in my life...
